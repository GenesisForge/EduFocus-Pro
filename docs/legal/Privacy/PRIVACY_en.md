## What Data We Collect

**None.**

EduFocus Pro collects **zero personal data**. We don't track you, we don't profile you, and we don't know who you are.

**No analytics. No telemetry. No tracking. Nothing.**

We don't know:
- ‚ùå Who you are (name, email, age, location)
- ‚ùå What you study or how you perform
- ‚ùå When or how long you use the extension
- ‚ùå What device or browser you're using
- ‚ùå Any usage statistics or patterns
- ‚ùå Literally anything about you

---

## Where Your Data Lives

All data created in EduFocus Pro is stored **locally on your device** using Chrome's encrypted local storage API (`chrome.storage.local`).

### What Gets Stored Locally

Your device stores:

- ‚è±Ô∏è **Timer settings and history** - Pomodoro configurations, completed sessions
- üéØ **Focus statistics** - Study time, streaks, productivity metrics
- üìù **Notes** - All text, formatting, tags, and organization
- üß† **Quizzes** - Custom quizzes, questions, answers, results
- üóÇÔ∏è **Flashcards** - Decks, cards, study progress, spaced repetition data
- üìÖ **Tasks** - To-dos, deadlines, priorities
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Settings** - Language, theme, accessibility options

### How It's Stored

- **Format:** JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) - readable, standard format
- **Encryption:** Protected by Chrome's built-in storage encryption
- **Location:** Your browser's profile folder on your hard drive
- **Access:** Only you and the EduFocus Pro extension can access this data

### What This Means

**This data never leaves your computer.** It is not:
- ‚ùå Uploaded to servers
- ‚ùå Sent to cloud services
- ‚ùå Shared with third parties
- ‚ùå Accessible to Genesis Forge
- ‚ùå Transmitted over the internet

**Think of it like a notebook:** When you write in a physical notebook, the notes stay in that notebook. Same concept, but digital.

### Chrome Sync (Optional)

If you have Chrome sync enabled in your browser settings:
- Chrome may sync your EduFocus Pro data to your Google account
- This is a **Chrome feature**, not an EduFocus Pro feature
- We have no control over or visibility into Chrome sync
- Data synced through Chrome is encrypted by Google

**To disable extension sync:**
1. Go to `chrome://settings/syncSetup`
2. Click "Manage sync"
3. Disable "Extensions" sync
4. Your EduFocus Pro data will remain local-only

## Browser Permissions

EduFocus Pro requests minimal Chrome permissions. Here's exactly what we ask for and why:

### ‚úÖ Storage (Required)
**Permission:** `storage`

**Why we need it:**
- To save your notes, timers, settings, and study materials locally
- Without this, nothing would be saved when you close the extension

**What we can access:**
- Only our own storage space (isolated from other extensions and websites)
- Cannot read data from other extensions
- Cannot access cookies or browsing history

**Security:**

### üé§ Microphone (Optional - Only When Requested)

**When it's used:**
- **Only** when you click the microphone button in Notes
- Never runs in the background
- Permission request appears first time you use the feature

**How to control it:**
- Deny the permission prompt when it appears
- Revoke anytime: `chrome://settings/content/microphone`
- Or: `chrome://extensions` ‚Üí EduFocus Pro ‚Üí Remove permissions

**What we do with audio:**
- Audio is processed locally by Chrome's Web Speech API
- No audio is recorded, stored, or transmitted
- No audio files are created
- Processing happens entirely on your device

### ‚ùå Permissions We DON'T Request

We do **not** request:
- `tabs` - Can't see what websites you visit

## Why We Built It This Way

**Students deserve privacy while learning.**

Too many educational tools track students, collect data, and prioritize engagement over education. We built EduFocus Pro differently:

- üìö **Education-focused** - Learning, not surveillance
- üîí **Privacy-first** - Built with privacy from day one
- üÜì **Truly free** - No hidden costs or data harvesting
- üí™ **User-controlled** - Your data, your device, your choice

**This is education software built the way it should be: Private, secure, and focused on learning.**

---

## Simple Summary

**Your data = Your business**

Everything stays on your computer. We can't see it, don't want to see it, and designed the system so we couldn't see it even if we wanted to.

### Core Promise

- **Collect:** Nothing
- **Track:** Nothing
- **Share:** Nothing
- **Store remotely:** Nothing

### For Everyone

**Students:** Study privately without surveillance  
**Parents:** Your child's data stays safe  
**Teachers:** Recommend with confidence  
**Everyone:** Privacy without compromise
