## 📖 Translation Guidelines

### General Principles

**✅ DO:**

**Translate Naturally**
- Use natural, conversational language
- Translate meaning, not word-for-word
- Consider how native speakers would phrase it
- Make it sound like it was written originally in your language

**Keep It Concise**
- UI space is limited
- Shorter translations are usually better
- Avoid unnecessary words
- Match the brevity of the original when possible

**Maintain Consistency**
- Use the same translation for repeated terms
- Create a personal glossary of key terms
- Be consistent with capitalization
- Use consistent punctuation style

**Match the Tone**
- Friendly and encouraging for students
- Professional but not overly formal
- Educational but approachable
- Motivating and positive

**Preserve Technical Elements**
- Keep placeholders like `{0}`, `{time}`, `{count}` exactly as is
- Don't translate HTML tags or code
- Preserve special characters and formatting
- Keep numbers and units as provided

**Use Inclusive Language**
- Gender-neutral when possible
- Appropriate for ages 12-25
- Culturally sensitive
- Accessible to all learners

**❌ DON'T:**

**Avoid Machine Translation Without Review**
- Don't rely solely on Google Translate or similar tools
- Machine translation is acceptable as a starting point, but must be thoroughly reviewed
- Ensure natural phrasing and proper context

**Don't Over-Translate**
- Keep brand names as is: "EduFocus Pro", "Genesis Forge"
- Don't translate technical terms that are universally known (e.g., "Chrome", "JSON")
- Standard educational terms may stay in English if commonly used

**Don't Add or Remove Information**
- Don't add extra explanation not in the original
- Don't remove information to make it shorter
- Don't change the meaning or intent

**Don't Use Overly Formal Language**
- Avoid academic or bureaucratic tone
- Don't use archaic or overly complex words
- Students should feel comfortable, not intimidated

**Don't Include Cultural References**
- Avoid idioms that don't translate well
- Skip cultural references specific to your country
- Keep it globally accessible

**Don't Modify Placeholders**
- Never change `{0}` or `{variable}` format
- Don't translate the placeholder names
- Don't remove or add extra placeholders

---

### Specific Guidelines by Category

#### Button and Label Text

**Keep it short:** Buttons have limited space
- ✅ "Start" → "Starten" (German)
- ❌ "Begin the timer now" → "Beginnen Sie den Timer jetzt"

**Use imperative form:** Commands should be action-oriented
- ✅ "Save" → "Guardar" (Spanish)
- ✅ "Delete" → "Supprimer" (French)

**Be consistent:** Same action = same word everywhere
- If "Save" is "Zapisz" in Polish, use it everywhere, not "Zapisz", "Zachowaj", "Przechowaj"

#### Educational Terminology

**Research standard terms:** Use accepted educational vocabulary
- "Flashcard" might be "Flashcard" (Danish), "Fiszka" (Polish), or "Cartão de memória" (Portuguese)
- Check educational websites in your language for standard terms

**Consider your audience:** Terms for 12-year-olds vs 18-year-olds
- Use age-appropriate vocabulary
- Avoid overly simplistic or childish language
- Make it suitable for secondary/high school students

#### Numbers and Time

**Follow local conventions:**
- Time format: 24-hour vs 12-hour
- Decimal separator: comma vs period
- Thousands separator: space, comma, or period

**Example from template:**

**"pomodoroComplete": "Pomodoro complete! Take a {0}-minute break."**

* German: "Pomodoro abgeschlossen! Mach eine {0}-minütige Pause."
* French: "Pomodoro terminé ! Prenez une pause de {0} minutes."
* Spanish: "¡Pomodoro completado! Toma un descanso de {0} minutos."

### Error Messages
Be helpful, not alarming:

* ✅ "Please enter a valid number"
* ❌ "ERROR: Invalid input detected!"

Provide guidance:
* Explain what went wrong
* Suggest how to fix it
* Keep it friendly

Example:
```json
"invalidTime": "Please enter a time between 1 and 120 minutes."
```

### Motivational Messages
Keep the positive tone:
* Encourage without being patronizing
* Celebrate achievements appropriately
* Match the enthusiasm level of the original

Cultural appropriateness:
* Some cultures prefer subtle encouragement
* Others appreciate more enthusiastic praise
* Adjust slightly while maintaining the spirit

## 📖 Style Guide Reference

### Capitalization
English style (title case for headings):
* "Study Timer Settings" ✅
* "Study timer settings" ❌ (for main headings)

German style (noun capitalization):
* "Lernzeiteinstellungen" ✅ (nouns capitalized)

French style (sentence case):
* "Paramètres de minuterie d'étude" ✅
* "Paramètres De Minuterie D'Étude" ❌

Follow your language's standard conventions.

### Punctuation
Buttons: Usually no period
* "Save" ✅
* "Save." ❌

Complete sentences: Use appropriate punctuation
* "Your quiz has been saved." ✅
* "Your quiz has been saved" ❌

Questions: Always end with question mark
* "Are you sure?" ✅

### Tone Examples
Friendly and Encouraging:
* English: "Great job! You've completed 5 study sessions today."
* Spanish: "¡Buen trabajo! Has completado 5 sesiones de estudio hoy."
* German: "Gut gemacht! Du hast heute 5 Lernsitzungen abgeschlossen."
* French: "Excellent travail ! Tu as terminé 5 sessions d'étude aujourd'hui."

Professional but Approachable:
* English: "Export your data to keep a backup of your study materials."
* Polish: "Eksportuj swoje dane, aby zachować kopię zapasową materiałów do nauki."

Clear and Instructive:
* English: "Click 'Start' to begin your Pomodoro session."
* Ukrainian: "Натисніть 'Почати', щоб розпочати сеанс Pomodoro."

## 🔧 Technical Details

### File Format
Translations are stored in JSON format within translations.js:
```javascript
const translations = {
  en: {
    // English translations
    "welcome": "Welcome to EduFocus Pro",
    "start": "Start",
    // ...
  },
  de: {
    // German translations
    "welcome": "Willkommen bei EduFocus Pro",
    "start": "Starten",
    // ...
  }
};
```

### Placeholders
Placeholders are used for dynamic content:

Common placeholder formats:
* {0}, {1}, {2} - Numbered placeholders
* {time} - Time values
* {count} - Counting values
* {name} - Name variables
* {date} - Date values

Example:
```json
"studyTime": "You studied for {0} minutes today."
```

Translation rules:
1. Keep placeholders exactly as they appear
2. You can reorder them if your language requires it
3. Don't remove or add placeholders
4. Don't translate the placeholder names

Correct:
```json
// English
"greeting": "Hello {name}, you have {count} new messages."

// French (reordered for natural flow)
"greeting": "Bonjour {name}, tu as {count} nouveaux messages."

// German
"greeting": "Hallo {name}, du hast {count} neue Nachrichten."
```

Incorrect:
```json
// ❌ Removed placeholder
"greeting": "Bonjour, tu as de nouveaux messages."

// ❌ Translated placeholder name
"greeting": "Hallo {Name}, du hast {Anzahl} neue Nachrichten."

// ❌ Added extra placeholder
"greeting": "Bonjour {name}, tu as {count} nouveaux messages à {time}."
```

### Character Encoding
* All files must be saved as UTF-8 encoding
* This ensures proper display of special characters
* Most modern text editors default to UTF-8

Special characters that need UTF-8:
* Accented letters: é, ñ, ü, ø, ą
* Non-Latin scripts: Cyrillic (Б, Г, Д), Arabic (ع, غ, ف), etc.
* Special symbols: €, £, ¥

### String Keys
Don't translate the keys (left side):
```json
// ✅ Correct
"saveButton": "Guardar"

// ❌ Wrong - key translated
"botónGuardar": "Guardar"
```

The key (before the colon) must remain in English. Only translate the value (after the colon).

### Special Characters in JSON
Characters that need escaping:
* Quotes: Use \" for quotes within strings
* Backslash: Use \\ for literal backslash
* Newline: Use \n for line breaks

Example:
```json
"quote": "He said, \"Success comes from hard work.\""
"path": "C:\\Users\\Student\\Documents"
"multiline": "Line 1\nLine 2"
```

### Example Notes Document
```
Translation Notes - French (fr)

Difficult Translations:
1. "Flashcard" - Used "Carte mémoire" instead of "Flashcard" as 
   it's more commonly used in French educational contexts.

2. "Pomodoro" - Kept as "Pomodoro" since it's a recognized 
   technique name globally, but added explanation in tooltip.

3. "Study streak" - Translated as "Série d'étude" rather than 
   direct translation to maintain positive connotation.

Alternatives Considered:
- "Save" could be "Sauvegarder" or "Enregistrer" - chose 
  "Enregistrer" for brevity.

Questions:
- Should time format be 24-hour (14:30) or 12-hour (2:30 PM)?
  Currently used 24-hour as it's more common in France.

UI Suggestions:
- "Settings" button could be wider to accommodate 
  "Paramètres" without wrapping.

## ❓ FAQ

### General Questions
Q: I'm not a professional translator. Can I still help?
A: Absolutely! Native fluency is more important than professional experience. We'll work with you throughout the process.

Q: How long will this take?
A: Most translators complete it in 6-9 hours total, usually over 1-2 weeks. Work at your own pace.

Q: What if I make mistakes?
A: We'll review everything and work with you to make corrections. Don't worry about perfection - we'll refine it together.

Q: Can I translate just part of it?
A: We prefer complete translations, but if you can only do certain sections, let us know. We might be able to find someone to complete the rest.

Q: Is there a deadline?
A: No strict deadline. We'd prefer completion within 4-6 weeks, but we're flexible.

Q: Can two people work together on one language?
A: Yes! Collaboration is great. Just coordinate between yourselves and submit one final version.

### Technical Questions
Q: I don't know how to edit JSON files. Can you help?
A: Yes! We can provide a spreadsheet format instead, or guide you through using a text editor.

Q: What if my language reads right-to-left (RTL)?
A: Great question! Let us know - we'll need to make additional UI adjustments. We can work together on this.

Q: My language has formal/informal forms. Which should I use?
A: Use informal (tu/du) rather than formal (vous/Sie). EduFocus Pro targets students, so a friendly tone is appropriate.

Q: What about plural forms in my language?
A: Some languages have complex plural rules. If needed, we can add support for multiple plural forms. Let us know during translation.

Q: Can I use regional dialects?
A: Prefer standard/neutral dialect that's widely understood. For example, "Español neutro" rather than specific regional Spanish.

### Translation Questions
Q: Some English phrases don't translate well. What should I do?
A: Translate the meaning/intent rather than word-for-word. When in doubt, ask us - we can adjust the original English if needed.

Q: Should I translate "Pomodoro"?
A: "Pomodoro Technique" is internationally recognized, so keeping "Pomodoro" is fine. You can add explanation in tooltips.

Q: What about measurement units?
A: Keep times in minutes/hours as is. If your country uses different standards, we can discuss adjusting the UI.

Q: Can I suggest UI changes?
A: Absolutely! If something works better in your language with a UI change, let us know. We're flexible.

### Credit & Recognition
Q: Can I use a pseudonym?

A: Yes, if you'd like! We're happy to link to your website, GitHub, or professional profile.

Q: Can I mention this in my portfolio?
A: Absolutely! Feel free to showcase your contribution in your portfolio, resume, or LinkedIn.
