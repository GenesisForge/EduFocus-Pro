- Encrypted at rest by the browser
- No server-side storage
- No cloud synchronization

**Minimal Permissions**
- Only requests necessary Chrome permissions
- No access to browsing history
- No access to other websites
- No access to personal information

## üö® Reporting a Vulnerability

### How to Report

If you discover a security vulnerability in EduFocus Pro, please report it responsibly:

**Email:** edufocusbusiness@gmail.com  
**Subject:** SECURITY VULNERABILITY - [Brief Description]

**Please DO NOT:**
- Create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities
- Disclose the vulnerability publicly before we've addressed it
- Exploit the vulnerability beyond what's necessary to demonstrate it

### What to Include

Please provide as much information as possible:

**Required Information:**
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Affected version(s)

**Helpful Additional Information:**
- Proof of concept code
- Screenshots or videos demonstrating the issue
- Suggested mitigation or fix (if you have one)
- Your assessment of severity (Low/Medium/High/Critical)

**Your Information:**
- Your name or pseudonym (for credit)
- Contact email
- Whether you want public acknowledgment

### Example Report

Subject: SECURITY VULNERABILITY - XSS in Note Title Field
Description:
Cross-site scripting vulnerability in the note title field allows
execution of arbitrary JavaScript when viewing notes.
Steps to Reproduce:

1. Create a new note
2. In the title field, enter: alert('XSS')
3. Save the note
4. Navigate to Notes tab
5. JavaScript executes when note is displayed

Impact:

* Could allow malicious scripts to access local storage
* Could manipulate or exfiltrate user notes
* Affects all users on version 3.5.3

Affected Version: 1.0.0
Browser: Chrome 120.0.6099.109
OS: Windows 11
Suggested Fix:
Sanitize all user input before rendering. Use textContent
instead of innerHTML for note titles.

## üîê Security Best Practices for Users

### Protecting Your Data

**Device Security:**
- Keep Chrome updated to the latest version

**Extension Security:**
- Only install EduFocus Pro from the official Chrome Web Store
- Verify the publisher is "Genesis Forge"
- Don't install modified versions from third parties
- Report suspicious extension behavior immediately

**Data Backups:**
- Regularly export your data (Settings ‚Üí Export All Data)
- Store backups in a secure location
- Test backup restoration periodically
- Keep multiple backup versions

**Safe Browsing:**
- Don't enter sensitive information in notes if device is shared
- Log out of shared computers completely
- Clear browser data if using a public computer
- Be cautious of phishing attempts

## üö´ Out of Scope

The following are **not** considered security vulnerabilities:

**By Design:**
- Local storage is accessible if device is compromised (use device security)
- Data loss if browser data is cleared without backup (user responsibility)
- Performance issues or crashes (report as bugs, not security)

**Social Engineering:**
- Phishing attacks impersonating Genesis Forge
- Social engineering to obtain exported data from users
- Tricking users into installing malicious extensions

**Third-Party Issues:**
- Vulnerabilities in Chrome browser itself
- OS-level security issues
- Hardware vulnerabilities

**Already Known:**
- Issues listed in our public issue tracker
- Issues in unsupported versions (< 3.3)

Please report these through normal support channels (edufocusbusiness@gmail.com) rather than as security vulnerabilities.
